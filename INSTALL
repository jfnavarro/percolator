Luminator and Qvalumity building and installation steps.

FOR LINUX USERS:

This package produces three different executables: Qvalumity, Luminator and Elude.

The building process requires 'cmake' utility, which can be installed by
running command 'sudo apt-get install cmake'.

In order to build mentioned executables, run 'build_me.sh' building script (./build_me.sh)
which will create 'output' folder for out-of-source build.
The default target for building(what can be changed in this script) is 'install'
with Debug configuration. 
Default installation directory on the target machine is '/usr/local/bin'.

After building, executable files (for all mentioned executables) also can be found
in created 'bin' directory (which can be found at the same level as 'src' folder).

In order to produce release version of the code, parameter
'-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release' should be given to cmake in building script file,
for example: 'cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..'
By default Debug configuration of programs is produced.

In order to make source and distribution packages the following commands
should be executed in created 'output' folder(after running 'cmake ..' in this folder):
'make package_source' and 'make package' respectively. Created packages can be found
in same 'output' folder.

In order to commit .gitignore file among others, please instruct git to add it explicitly:
git add -f .gitignore

The commands `./qvalumity --help', `./luminator --help' or './elude --help'
in created 'bin' folder will give full usage statements.
