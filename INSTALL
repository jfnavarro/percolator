Luminator and Qvalumity building and installation steps.

FOR LINUX USERS:

This package produces two different executables: Qvalumity and Luminator.

The building process requires 'cmake' utility, which can be installed by
running command 'sudo apt-get install cmake'.

In order to build Luminator and Qvalumity executables, go to folder 'build_here'
(or create an empty one if it doesn't exist, which should be placed at the same
level as 'src' folder).

Being in 'build_here' folder run command 'cmake ..' and after it will be successfuly
completed, run command 'make' and finally 'sudo make install' (or only 'sudo make install'
if executables should be automatically installed after building).
Default installation directory on the target machine is '/usr/local/bin'.

After building, executable files (both for Luminator and Qvalumity) also can be found
in created 'bin' directory (which can be found at the same level as 'build_here'
and 'src' folders).

In order to produce a debug version of the code, parameter
'-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug' should be given to cmake, for example:
'cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..'

By default an optimized release version of programs is produced.
'build_me.sh' script in 'build_here' folder builds debug version of software.

In order to make source and distribution packages the following commands
should be executed after 'cmake ..': 'make package_source' and
'make package' respectively. Created packages can be found in 'build_here' folder.

NOTE: In case of generating source package, in order not to force target user to
create external building folder(like 'build_here' in this case) - an extra folder
with the name different from current build folder (which is 'build_here')
should be created and left non-empty (containing, for example, just a README file like
'build_here' does). This non-empty folder will pass through CPack ignorance filters
and will be archived with other files/folders in source
package (so it will simply serve as 'build_here' folder in destination package).

In order to commit .gitignore file among others, instruct git to add it explicitely:
git add -f .gitignore

The commands `./qvalumity --help' or  `./luminator --help' in created 'bin'
folder will give full usage statements.
