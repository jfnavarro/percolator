v1.13
* Filtering out redundant peptides before retention time regression training
* Bugfix for retention time feature calculation
* Introduced a percolator -r and qvality -o option to redirect stdout to file
  (important in the windows environment). 
* Updated percolator xml scheme to include decoy PSMs id -Z switch set 

v1.12
* Changed licensing scheme for percolator
* PNGase F feature (option -N) introduced

v1.11
* Bugfix for qvality binning procedure
* Introduced a sqrt(abs(dM)*abs(dRT)) feature for the Description of correct

v1.10
* Changed merging procedure of cross validation sets sio that the
  scores so that the decoy score between the first
  and 10th percentile becomes uniform (rather than first and third
  quantile as previously)
* Added independent train and test set for determining the gamma and C
  parameters in the retention time calculation.
* Corrected a binning procedure bug, who's symptom has been a
  "bad_alloc()" error statement.

v1.09
* Removed bug in the normalization of retention times when using tab
  delimited input.
* Introduced a range limit in the iterative least square procedure used
  in the Posterior Error Probability calculations. 

v 1.08
* Retention time and callibration calculations are now available from
  tab delimited files as well.
* Output xml-files according to the definitions in
  http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/percolator/model/percolator_out.xsd

v 1.07
* Command line switch to output decoy scores (-B)
* Switch for replacing retention time features with the Klammer et al. features.

v 1.06
* Retention time calculation
* Added features for differenceto mean - retention time, pI and calibration
* Changed cross validation strategy so that only one target and one decoy set should be given as input.
