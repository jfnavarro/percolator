This package potentially produces two different executables
qvality and percolator.

The shell commands `$ ./configure; make; make install' should
configure, build, and install the executables if you downloaded a packaged version.

If you have automake istalled you may get a snapshot that you build by the command series
$ git clone git://github.com/percolator/percolator
$ cd percolator/src
$ bash bootstrap
$ mkdir debug; cd debug
$ ../configure --enable-debug
$ make


The commands `$ qvality --help' or  `$ percolator --help' will give full
usage statements.
